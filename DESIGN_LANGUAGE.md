# Design Language

## Core Philosophy

Norwegian UI design is quiet, trustworthy, and humane.
The interface should recede, allowing the user's task to come forward.

If something feels impressive, clever, loud, or marketing-driven, it is probably wrong.

Design quality is communicated through restraint, clarity, and consistency, not through decoration.

## 1. Typography: Calm Authority, Not Emphasis

Typography in Norwegian interfaces avoids visual aggression.

- Use one sans-serif typeface only
- Emphasis is achieved through slightly heavier weight, not bold
- Bold text is rare and reserved for exceptional moments
- Text should feel readable, balanced, and confident, not attention-seeking

Hierarchy comes from:

- Size
- Weight
- Spacing

Never from multiple fonts, italics, or decorative styles.

Text is slightly larger and more comfortable than dense enterprise software.
Reading should feel effortless, even for long sessions.

## 2. Color: Quiet, Neutral, Trust-Building

Norwegian interfaces are intentionally low-contrast in emotion, not in accessibility.

- Start from neutral, slightly warm light surfaces
- Avoid cold whites and pure black
- Use one brand color, expressed through subtle tonal variation
- Semantic colors (success, warning, error) are muted, never vivid

Color is used to support meaning, not to decorate or energize.

If color draws attention to itself, it is likely overused.

---

## 3. Spacing: Generosity Is a Feature

Whitespace is not empty — it is structural.

- Layouts breathe
- Components have generous internal padding
- Sections are clearly separated
- When unsure, add more space, not less

Norwegian interfaces consistently feel calmer than international counterparts because elements are not crowded.

Dense layouts are perceived as stressful and low-trust.

---

## 4. Shape: Soft, Modern, Finished

Sharp edges feel technical and unfinished.

- Corners are gently rounded
- Shapes are consistent across the system
- Nothing feels playful or exaggerated

The goal is to feel approachable and modern, not expressive.

---

## 5. Elevation: Barely There

Depth is suggested, not declared.

- Shadows are extremely subtle or replaced with light borders
- Heavy shadows feel dated and intrusive
- Separation is achieved through spacing first, elevation second

If a shadow is clearly noticeable, it is probably too strong.

---

## 6. Iconography: Functional, Not Expressive

Icons support navigation and comprehension — they are not illustrations.

- Line icons over filled icons
- Consistent stroke weight
- Icons align naturally with text
- Active states change color or fill, not size or position

Icons should disappear into the system, not stand out.

---

## 7. Layout & Information Density: Reveal Slowly

Norwegian UIs strongly favor progressive disclosure.

- Start minimal
- Show only what is necessary now
- Reveal complexity as the user goes deeper

Common patterns:

- Collapsible navigation
- Expandable cards
- Layered panels instead of dense dashboards
- Empty first states that invite creation

The user is trusted to explore — not forced to absorb everything at once.

---

## 8. Navigation: Fewer Choices, Clear Direction

Navigation is shallow and restrained.

- Few top-level options
- Clear labels
- Predictable placement
- Search is often treated as navigation itself

Deep, nested menus are avoided whenever possible.
Orientation matters more than speed of access to every feature.

---

## 9. Motion: Invisible When Done Right

Motion exists to explain, not impress.

- Fast, subtle transitions
- No bouncing, easing theatrics, or playful effects
- No autoplay
- No surprise modals
- No attention-seeking animations

If the user notices the animation, it has failed its purpose.

---

## 10. Onboarding: Reduce Friction Before Teaching

Norwegian products prioritize getting started over explaining everything.

- Minimal sign-up requirements
- No forced tutorials
- Guidance happens through the interface itself
- Empty states explain what to do next

The product earns trust by being usable immediately.

---

## 11. Copy & Tone: Direct, Human, Unpretentious

Language is calm and respectful.

- Short, clear sentences
- No hype, no slogans, no marketing language
- Sentence case, not title case
- Questions instead of commands
- Errors explain what happened and how to fix it

The interface speaks like a competent colleague, not a salesperson.

---

## 12. Accessibility: Non-Negotiable

Accessibility is not an enhancement — it is a baseline expectation.

- Strong contrast
- Large touch targets
- Clear focus states
- Keyboard navigation everywhere
- Color is never the only signal

Designing for inclusivity is seen as good design, not compliance work.

---

## 13. Cultural Signals Embedded in the UI

A Norwegian-styled UI reflects deeper values:

**Trust through restraint**
Loud interfaces feel untrustworthy.

**Egalitarianism**
Interfaces feel the same regardless of role or status.

**Low-light comfort**
Soft surfaces and calm contrast reduce eye strain.

**International neutrality**
Layouts accommodate long words and multiple languages gracefully.

**Sustainability & seriousness**
The UI feels durable, not trendy.

## The Norwegian UI Litmus Test

Before adding anything, ask:

- Does this reduce cognitive load?
- Does it feel calm, not clever?
- Is it necessary right now?
- Would this still feel good after years of daily use?
- Does it respect the user's attention?

If the answer is no — remove it.
